Originally built to show Mythic+ Loot in the Encounter Journal, this addon now serves various small Quality of Life improvements to the base UI:



Shows the highest item level you have ever equipped when mousing over an equipped item on your character sheet
Shows the potential upgrade range for current seasonal items that can be upgraded, eg: Hero (428-441)
When mousing over the M+ details for what you have completed this season, if you have unlocked that dungeons teleport button, provides the button. Can also provide alternative teleports for the next-nearest place you can teleport to, if you do not have it yet. Eg: if you have not earned the Brackenhide Hollow teleport, it can show the Azure Vault teleport instead if you have it.
Makes your "Warband Transferable" icons always visible on the Currency UI
The Wardrobe Class dropdown will show the class names with their respective class colours
Adds the "Expansion Features" category to the progress bars in the Achievement UI
Fixes a bug on Blizzards end that prevents tracked account-wide acheivements completed on an alt from properly being untracked
Delves: displays how many T8 Delves you need to complete to finish your Vault
Displays target players item level when inspecting them
Makes the Keystone UI movable
Hides the Red X next to the Filter button on the Premade Finder (it gets in the way of the Refresh button!)
