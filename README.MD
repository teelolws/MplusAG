Originally built to show Mythic+ Loot in the Encounter Journal, this addon now serves various small Quality of Life improvements to the base UI:



- Shows the Loot Tab on the Encounter Journal when the current expansion is selected
- Shows the highest item level you have ever equipped when mousing over an equipped item on your character sheet
- Shows the highest fortified/tyrannical key you have done depending on whether the current week is a fortified or tyrannical week
- Shows the potential upgrade range for Dragonflight Season 2 items that can be upgraded, eg: Hero (428-441)
- When mousing over the M+ details for what you have completed this season, if you have unlocked that dungeons teleport button, provides the button. Can also provide alternative teleports for the next-nearest place you can teleport to, if you do not have it yet. Eg: if you have not earned the Brackenhide Hollow teleport, it can show the Azure Vault teleport instead if you have it.
- Makes your "Warband Transferable" icons always visible on the Currency UI
- The Wardrobe Class dropdown will show the class names with their respective class colours
